# Hobby Project: Command and Control (C2) System

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a lightweight Command and Control (C2) system to simulate real-time communication and coordination among various units for specific scenarios, such as disaster response or military simulation games.

## Key Features
1. **User Interface**: 
   - A web-based dashboard to monitor and control operations.
   - Interactive maps for situational awareness, displaying the location of units and resources.

2. **Real-Time Communication**:
   - Implement chat functionality for unit communication.
   - Use WebSockets for real-time messaging between users.

3. **Data Management**:
   - Create a simple database to store user information, mission data, and communication logs.
   - Use a JSON file or SQLite for data storage.

4. **Task Assignment**:
   - Allow commanders to assign tasks to units and track their status.
   - Implement a task management feature with status updates (e.g., "In Progress," "Completed").

5. **Notifications**:
   - Set up alerts for critical updates (e.g., new tasks, status changes).

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (using frameworks like React or Vue.js)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for server-side operations
- **Database**: SQLite or JSON for lightweight data management
- **Communication**: Socket.io for real-time communication

## Project Steps
1. **Define Scope**: Outline the specific scenario and features you want to include.
2. **Design UI**: Create wireframes for the dashboard and user interactions.
3. **Set Up Development Environment**: Install necessary tools (Node.js, frontend framework).
4. **Develop Frontend**: Build the user interface and integrate map features (e.g., using Leaflet or Google Maps API).
5. **Develop Backend**: Set up server, routes, and database connectivity.
6. **Implement Real-Time Features**: Use WebSockets for chat and task notifications.
7. **Testing**: Conduct user testing to refine functionality and usability.
8. **Documentation**: Write a user guide and technical documentation for your system.

## Outcome
By the end of this project, you will have a functioning mini C2 system that simulates command and control operations. This project will enhance your programming skills and provide insight into real-world military communication and coordination challenges. Plus, it's a fun way to apply your knowledge in a practical setting!
